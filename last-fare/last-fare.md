# Last Fare
### A thriller driving simulator about a rideshare driver completing his shift day after day.

## Game Mechanics
Every night, the player clocks in to work. Starting their shift at the wheel, they start at their house every night.

### Interactables
The car's interior is the main setting for the game.
- There is a rearview mirror that the player can look at to see the backseat and behind the car.
- There are side view mirrors that the player can look at to see to the sides and behind the car.
- There is a windshield mounted phone that can display the rideshare app and a GPS.
- There is a gear shift and a steering wheel that the user must control most of the time.

### UI/HUD
There is no HUD for in game actions, instead, all game mechanics related to driving are controlled and monitored via. the car's dashboard and the phone's screen.

There is UI for the in game dialogue system. This system displays at the bottom of the screen and functions as a basic dialogue display.

### Game Loop
The main game loop starts with the player getting in their car to start their shift for the day. The player starts by accepting or rejecting rides to people on the app.

When the player accepts a ride on the app, they get the route to the customer mapped on their GPS.

The player then has control over the car, and can go to the customer's location. The player can take whatever route they want to in order to get to the customer.

Then there is dialogue between the player and the customer and the player must have conversations to ensure the customer's satisfaction and simultaneously get them to their destination in a timely fashion.

## Core Tension: The Rearview Mirror as Inspection Booth

The rearview mirror is the central tension mechanic—the equivalent of the document inspection desk in Papers, Please. Driving demands eyes on the road, but survival increasingly demands watching the passenger.

### Attention Tax
Looking in the mirror too long causes the car to drift lanes or miss turns. Not looking means missing critical passenger behaviors:
- Someone reaching into a bag
- A hand moving toward the door handle at speed
- A face that doesn't match the profile photo

The player should constantly feel torn between two competing surveillance tasks, and the game punishes neglecting either one.

### Passenger Body Language System
Passengers communicate through behavior, not dialogue. Over time, players develop literacy in micro-behaviors—some benign, some threats:
- A passenger bouncing their knee: anxiety or impatience
- Someone glancing repeatedly out the rear window: possibly being followed
- A passenger putting on gloves mid-ride: alarming signal
- Fidgeting with a bag or pocket

Misreading behaviors has consequences in both directions:
- Kicking out a nervous but harmless passenger tanks your rating
- Ignoring a genuine threat gets you hurt

## The Phone as Competing Systems

The phone is the player's multi-document workspace—the thing that creates cognitive overload.

### Rideshare App
Shows limited passenger info before acceptance:
- Name, photo, rating
- Pickup pin location
- Destination

Players learn to read this information like documents:
- A 4.2-star passenger requesting pickup from a known bad intersection at 2 AM is a different calculus than a 4.9-star from a hotel lobby
- Rider notes that sometimes contradict what the passenger actually says or does ("going to the airport" but the pin is in a residential dead-end)

### Notifications & Messages
A message/notification layer creates personal pressure competing for attention:
- Texts from a landlord about rent
- A family member asking when you'll be done
- News notifications about something happening in your driving area

These compete for attention exactly when focus is needed on driving or watching the passenger. This is the equivalent of Papers, Please's ticking clock and family expenses screen—the squeeze from both sides.

### GPS Manipulation
Passengers can attempt to manipulate routing:
- "Hey, take a left here, I know a shortcut."
- Do you follow the GPS or the passenger's instructions?
- Following might be a genuine shortcut—or routing you somewhere isolated

This is a trust mechanic that escalates over the course of the game.

---

## Car Degradation

The car is the workspace and it decays under neglect:
- Gas levels requiring stops
- Tire wear affecting handling
- Check engine light growing more urgent
- Cracked windshield from incidents obscuring vision until repaired

Maintenance costs money, creating another pressure point.

---

## Tips as Moral Lever

Certain passengers tip well if you comply with their requests:
- Take the weird route
- Don't ask questions
- "Forget" what you saw

The game makes it financially painful to be ethical.

---

## Escalating Verification Mechanics

Each new complication is a new "document rule" to track:

### Profile Photo Mismatch
The person at pickup doesn't look like the app photo. Do you let them in? Maybe it's an outdated photo. Maybe it's someone using a stolen account.

### Destination Mismatch
They get in and immediately ask to go somewhere different than the app says.

### Passenger Count Mismatch
The app says one rider, but two people approach the car.

### Pattern Recognition
- Repeat pickup locations the player learns to recognize
- Mental or physical blacklist the player builds
- Crude notes system on the phone to flag addresses or names—a personal border inspector stamp book

## Items Left Behind

Passengers leave things in the car: a phone, a wallet, a bag.

### Choices
- **Return it**: Costs time, might earn a reward
- **Keep it**: Some items have value or information
- **Ignore it**: Move on, but consequences may follow

### Evidence Items
Some items are dangerous—a bag with something you shouldn't have seen, a phone buzzing with revealing messages. Suddenly you're holding something incriminating and must decide:
- Turn it in? To whom?
- The cops might ask questions you don't want to answer
- The passenger might come looking for it

### Contraband Mechanic
A passenger asks you to hold onto something or deliver something. You don't know what's in it. The money is good. This is the "EZIC" equivalent—a shadow faction pulling you into complicity one small favor at a time.

## Atmosphere & World Building

### Police Scanner / Local Radio
Plays during drives, serving double duty:
- Builds atmosphere
- Delivers information for piecing together the larger story:
  - A missing persons report matching a passenger from last night
  - A crime at an address you just dropped someone at
  - A description of a suspect vehicle that sounds like yours

Players passively absorb narrative through audio while actively managing driving and passenger interaction—three layers of attention.

### City Evolution
The same streets feel different as in-game weeks pass:
- More police presence, or less
- Certain areas cordoned off
- A building that burned down
- The city changes in response to events the player may or may not have influenced

---

## Storyline & Twist Ideas (Brainstorm)

### Option 1: The Other Driver
News reports emerge about a rideshare driver involved in something terrible—assaults, disappearances, escalating incidents. Descriptions are vague but details rhyme uncomfortably with your situation: same car color, same operating area, same hours. Passengers act nervous. The police scanner mentions your neighborhood.

Possible directions:
- You're being framed by someone who knows your patterns
- There IS another driver and you're converging toward confronting them
- Unreliable narrator reveal: the player character IS the other driver, and the game has shown evidence all along of dissociation or blackouts

### Option 2: The Passenger Who Knows You
A recurring thread across multiple nights: a passenger (different accounts, or the same one) who knows things they shouldn't—your real name, where you live, what happened on a previous shift. They're pleasant, they tip well, and they're terrifying. They never threaten directly. They just know. The player must figure out who this person is and what they want, with the answer tying into the larger plot.

### Option 3: The Recursive Shift
Subtle at first—a passenger looks familiar. A ride request to an address visited before, but the name is different. The city starts repeating. Same conversations, same routes, but with small mutations. A passenger who was alive last week is now a missing person on the news.

This works as psychological horror without supernatural explanation—chronic night shifts and sleep deprivation fracturing perception. Or something is genuinely wrong with the city. The ambiguity is the horror.

---

## The Final Ride

The game's title should pay off. Build toward a final ride that the entire game has been setting up.

Every faction, every decision, every item left behind, every route taken—it all converges on one passenger, one destination, one choice.

The best version: the player doesn't realize the final ride is the final ride until they're already in it. The passenger gets in and says something that recontextualizes the entire game. Who this person is and what happens depends on everything the player has done.

**The Last Fare is literal.**
